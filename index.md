I am a PhD Candidate in the [Collective Behaviour Lab](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/researchfc/groups/grupo-collective-behavior) in the [Champalimaud Research](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/researchfc/) at the [Champalimaud Center for the Uknown](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/) in Lisbon, Portugal. During my PhD I've developed [idtracker.ai](https://idtrackerai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), performed behavior experiments in collectives of zebrafish (Danio Rerio), and applied different data analysis techniques to understand how animals transfer information in groups.
